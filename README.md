Open Cricket aims to provide free access to all cricket statistics via API. By statistics, it includes:

 - Scorecards of concluded matches - ODI, Test & T20I
 - Ball by Ball details
 - Player profiles

How it works?
=============

You can ask questions like *When was the last time India chased down 300+ successfully?* or *Which team has the most number of the consecutive wins this year?*.

Why?
====

With huge amount of stats being generated every day, it is becoming really difficult to unearth the awesome facts that you wanted to know.
